### :round_pushpin: Purpose

The game itself has a limited number of built-in phrases that vary in length. After each round, the option of generating a new phrase is provided. The new phrase is randomly selected out of an array of about 15 different phrases. The game does not actually end, it will keep randomly selecting a new phrase. This will be worked on in the future, but it should be noted that the phrases will repeat!
