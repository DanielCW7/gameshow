This phrase guessing game is a mixture of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

The game itself has a limited number of built-in phrases that vary in length. After each round, the option of generating a new phrase is provided. The new phrase is randomly selected out of an array of about 15 different phrases. The game does not actually end, it will keep randomly selecting a new phrase. This will be worked on in the future, but it should be noted that the phrases will repeat! 

Also, this page is not mobile responsive...Yet! It will only work on screen sizes larger than 768px.
